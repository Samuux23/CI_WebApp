📊 How It Works (Brief)
Evaluates 7 inputs: 1. Time alone 2. Stage fear 3. Social events/month 4. Outings/week 5. Post-social energy 6. Close friends 7. Social post frequency

Algorithm (simplified):
• Normalize inputs (0–1)
• Weighted aggregate score
• Convert to probability‑style confidence
• Displays Introvert/Extrovert label with confidence %

🚀 Quick Start 1. Open web-app/index.html in your browser. 2. Fill in the form → Analyze My Personality. 3. View the label + confidence.

🌐 Deploy (GitHub Pages) 1. Push to GitHub. 2. Settings → Pages
• Source: Deploy from a branch
• Branch: main • Folder: / (or /web-app) 3. App URL: https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/

🎨 Customize
Edit gradients inside the <style> of index.html:

/_ Main _/
background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);
/_ Extrovert _/
